# Windows on ARM(64) device drivers for the Raspberry Pi platform
This repository is currently used only for publishing binary releases: https://github.com/worproject/RPi-Windows-Drivers/releases

The source code for some of the prebuilt drivers can be found here: https://github.com/raspberrypi/windows-drivers

## Notes
* most of the drivers require the *Test Signing mode* to be enabled.

* ARM32 drivers can't be installed on an ARM64 image or vice versa.

* drivers included in the latest release that can't be found in the "bsp" repository above were either extracted from old builds of Windows 10 IoT Core (ARM32 binaries) or recompiled for ARM64 by their developers (thanks to [MCCI](https://mcci.com) and [Microchip](https://www.microchip.com)).

* some of the new drivers / features are not yet open-sourced because the code needs to be heavily refactored. It's good enough to "get the thing working", but it can't be used as a base for further development. Watch the repository above for updates on this.

### To UEFI / driver developers
The driver package for Raspberry Pi 4 installs a DSDT & SSDT table override that:
* changes the _HIDs of the
  * PL011 controller to BCM2887
  * XHCI controller to RPI0D10
  
  so Windows won't install the incompatible inbox drivers instead of our own versions. This is not necessary if the drivers are properly signed.
* fixes the PWM definition and adds an analog audio device
* adds dummy HDMI controller and digital audio devices

For ACPI changes in the UEFI to take effect, you need to uninstall this override by deleting `dsdtpatch` from the package or the `ACPITABL.dat` file from `%SystemRoot%\System32\`. As a result, Bluetooth, audio and the USB filter driver may stop working.

## Status

### (Official) peripherals
|Device|Driver|Status|Additional information|
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|7-inch DSI touch screen|Display: firmware-controlled, Touch: no driver available|**Partially working**|Only the display works, but the resolution may be wrong. See the RPi docs for details on how to change it through config.txt.|
